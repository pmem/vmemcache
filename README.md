libvmemcache: buffer based LRU cache
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pmem/vmemcache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pmem/vmemcache)
[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/github/pmem/vmemcache/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/gh/pmem/vmemcache/branch/master)

**libvmemcache** is an embeddable and lightweight in-memory caching solution.
It's designed to fully take advantage of large capacity memory, such as
Persistent Memory with DAX, through memory mapping in an efficient
and scalable way.

The things that make it unique are:
- Extent-based memory allocator which sidesteps the fragmentation
problem that affects most in-memory databases and allows the cache
to achieve very high space utilization for most workloads.
- Buffered LRU, which combines a traditional LRU doubly-linked
list with a non-blocking ring buffer to deliver high degree
of scalability on modern multi-core CPUs.
- Unique indexing structure, critnib, which delivers
high-performance while being very space efficient.

# Building The Source #

Requirements:
- cmake >= 3.3

Optional:
- valgrind (for tests)
- pandoc (for documentation)

For all systems:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pmem/vmemcache.git
$ cd vmemcache
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

And then:

### On RPM-based Linux distros (Fedora, openSUSE, RHEL, SLES) ###

```sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCPACK_GENERATOR=rpm
$ make package
$ sudo rpm -i libvmemcache*.rpm
```

### On DEB-based Linux distros (Debian, Ubuntu) ###

```sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCPACK_GENERATOR=deb
$ make package
$ sudo dpkg -i libvmemcache*.deb
```

### On other Linux distros ###
```sh
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/libvmemcache-bin
$ make
$ make install
```

# Statistics #

Statistics are enabled by default. They can be disabled at the compile time
of the libvmemcache library if the **STATS_ENABLED** CMake option is set to OFF.

See the man page for more information about statistics.
