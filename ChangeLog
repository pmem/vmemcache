	* Version 0.8
	This is the first official release of a libvmemcache. It's an embeddable
	and lightweight in-memory caching solution designed to fully take
	advantage of large capacity memory, such as Persistent Memory with DAX,
	through Memory Mapping in an efficient and scalable way.

	It includes, among other things:
	- Extent-based memory allocator which sidesteps the
	fragmentation problem that affects most in-memory databases and
	allows the cache to achieve very high space utilization for most
	workloads.
	- Buffered LRU, which combines a traditional LRU doubly-linked
	list with a non-blocking ring buffer to deliver high degree of
	scalability on modern multi-core CPUs.
	- Unique indexing structure, critnib, which delivers
	high-performance while being very space efficient.

	The reason this release has version 0.8 is because we are still looking
	for actual real world feedback before we stabilize the APIs and commit
	to maintaining backward compatibility. It does not mean that the library
	is unfinished or unstable. On the contrary, the cache is fully
	functional and we are confident in its quality.
